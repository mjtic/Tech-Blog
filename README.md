  ## Description:
  The intention of this project is to create an web application where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This web-application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
